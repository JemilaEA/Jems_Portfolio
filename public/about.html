<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> I am Jemila Enehua Abdulkadir, a 31 year old commencing my coding journey. My goal is to become a renowned
  web and software develper. I would love to leave my own little giant footprints in the coding world. I have
  always felt intimidated by the idea of coding, so most importantly, I would love to prove to myself that it
  CAN be done.</p>

<p> I am excited to relate with like minds and exoerts in the field and learn as much as possible as fast as possible.
  I am happy to be here.</p>
