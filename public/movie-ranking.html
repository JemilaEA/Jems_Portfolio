<h1>The Best Movies According to Jemila </h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<p> <hr /> </p>
<p><h3>A walk to remember</h3>
    It's such an emotionally wholesome movie. Showed <br />that even "hard guys" have the capacity to be kind.</p> 

<p><h3>Fast saga</h3>
It's the family spirit, the banter, the crazy rides, the <br />selection of villains and LETTY!!!.</p>
<p></p><h3>Age of Adaline</h3>
Showcased love between such varying characters. The <br />love between a mother and her daughter, a father and his son...<br /> A man, his wife and his former love... It's truly a beautiful thing.</p>
